You can edit/run code online with reading files via this file. In Implementation.ipynb, you need to mount drive (first code segment)
then run the code. Task 8 is added to this version of code. Because it needs to read (u,x) pairs from the file.

Will be less up-to-date version probably :(

- task4 should be finished with testing KPA_linear.hex file to finding key.
